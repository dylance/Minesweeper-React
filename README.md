# React MineSweeper

### About

I am trying to make a minesweeper game in react without looking at any example code.

So far I have rendered the board with mines and flags with correct count. I belive all edge cases are covered

To do:

- For Completion
  - Move the logic for generating the board outside of the componentDidMount
  - Hide Square values on Load
  - Implement logic and state management to play game


- After Completion
  - Allow user to select size of grid and number of mines
  - Add styling
  - Add timer
